# CompArch Lab 4: Addtional Features for a Single Cycle CPU
Daniel Connolly, Qingmu "Josh" Deng

## Microproposal
For lab 4 we are aiming for the following enhancement to our single cycle CPU:

* Add multiplication functionality to integer operations(to be able to verify factorial code on our cpu)
* A exception handler (MIPS coprocessor 0) that is able to handle exceptions in normal integer operations
* A floating point unit (MIPS coprocessor 1) that is able to add, subtract, multiply and divide
